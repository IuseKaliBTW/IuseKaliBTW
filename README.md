👨‍💻 About Me
🔭 I’m currently focused on mastering Front-End Development.

🌱 I'm learning React and the art of building beautiful, responsive user interfaces.

💡 I love clean code, creative problem-solving, and a perfectly configured VS Code setup.

🎮 When I'm not coding, I'm probably exploring new tech or diving into a good video game.

🎯 My goal is to transform ideas into reality through code and never stop learning.

⚡ Fun Facts
🎨 My quest for the perfect VS Code theme is a journey, not a destination.

☕ I believe console.log() is the most powerful debugging tool in the universe.

🧠 I think in <div>s and dream in flexbox.

🐞 I've spent hours hunting a bug, only to find it was a single misplaced semicolon.

🏆 My greatest achievement is perfectly centering a div on the first try (it happened once).
